# Chimplate

## Intro

This is our response to the CSS boilerplates.

We are trying to create a plate that let us create stuff in multiple levels:

- Variables
- Mixins
- Utils
- Helpers
- Elements
- Components

More on this [here](levels.md).

We are not going to lie. This plate is a frankenstein from the best things we found on the internet, from bootstrap to tailwind.
